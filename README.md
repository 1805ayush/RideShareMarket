# RideShareMarket

In this project, we aim to decentralize the system of booking rides by storing travel and transaction details of the rider on the blockchain.
Since the whole transaction will be publicly verifiable, trust issues can be minimized and issues of payment fraud can be verified and rectified easily. 
Peopleâ€™s identity will not get exposed due to the anonymous nature of the blockchain. This will ensure strengthened security and privacy standards. 
This whole system will make the transaction transparent, secure, and efficient.
